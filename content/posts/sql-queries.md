## Scenario

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to
investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently
discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and
employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and
log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from
different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
